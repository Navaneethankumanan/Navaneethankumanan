## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate learner working towards becoming a strong Android and Web Developer.  
I enjoy understanding how applications work end-to-end — from UI to backend to database.

Currently, I am rebuilding my foundations and focusing on writing code independently, improving consistency, and developing real-world projects step by step.

> 🏥 A healthcare management app built as a **live workflow engine**, synchronizing doctors and patients in real time.

- ⏱ Live appointment & queue updates  
- 🔁 Doctor-driven consultation flow  
- 🔐 Secure UID-based patient records  
- ⚡ Real-time database powered system  

<details>
<summary><b>Why this project is special</b></summary>

Most apps store data and wait.  
**QuickCare reacts instantly.**

When a doctor starts a consultation, the patient’s phone updates immediately — even if they are miles away.  
This real-time interaction is the core innovation of the app.

## 📚 Current Learning Focus
- Writing Android apps independently without AI dependency
- Deep understanding of Activities, Fragments, and app lifecycle
- Learning backend fundamentals (Node.js & REST APIs)
- Understanding how frontend, backend, and database communicate
- Building logic-heavy projects instead of UI-only apps

---

## 📈 Goals (Next Few Months)
- Build multiple Android practice apps from scratch
- Complete SureGuard with background & emergency services
- Learn SQL deeply and use it in a backend project
- Build and deploy a full-stack mini application
- Connect one backend to both web and mobile apps

---

⭐ I believe consistency beats intensity, and I’m committed to growing every day.
